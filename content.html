    <h1>all the dino info</h1>
    see how many facts I know!
    <br>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>The smallest known dinosaur was about the size of a pigeon (Microraptor), and it had four wings.</li>

        <li>The largest carnivore ever found, Spinosaurus, may have spent most of its time swimming—making it basically
            a giant murder-croc with a sail.</li>

        <li>T. rex had one of the strongest bites in history—up to 12,000 pounds of force. That’s like a small elephant
            standing on your hand.</li>

        <li>Many dinosaurs probably had feathers, even some big scary ones. Yes, your nightmare raptors were basically
            giant murder birds.</li>

        <li>Stegosaurus had a brain the size of a lime. And it lived over 80 million years before T. rex—so the two
            never met.</li>

        <li>Some dinos had built-in air conditioning. Sauropods had huge air sacs in their necks that helped regulate
            body temperature.</li>

        <li>The fastest dinosaurs (like Ornithomimids) could run up to about 40–50 mph—basically Jurassic ostriches.
        </li>

        <li>Triceratops had up to 800 teeth, arranged in stacks that continuously replaced each other.</li>

        <li>Ankylosaurus’s tail club could literally break a T. rex’s legs with one swing.</li>

        <li>Pterosaurs weren’t dinosaurs, but they lived alongside them—and some were the size of giraffes.</li>

        <li>Dinos lived on every continent, including Antarctica. Back then it was warmer and forested.</li>

        <li>We’re technically still living in the age of dinosaurs. Birds are classified as avian dinosaurs.</li>

        <li>Some dinosaurs swallowed rocks (gastroliths) to help grind up food, like giant prehistoric chickens.</li>

        <li>Dinosaurs didn’t roar like in movies. Many probably made low, resonant, birdlike or crocodile-like sounds.
        </li>

        <li>The asteroid that wiped them out hit with the power of 10 billion Hiroshima bombs.</li>
